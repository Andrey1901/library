</ul>

<!--Medj descrp.-->
<p>The most beautiful feature of Medjugorje is its simplicity, and its peace. While in Medjugorje, you will have the opportunity to experience your faith grow, and share in the faith journey of pilgrims from all over the world. The local guide will accompany your group throughout your stay in the village.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Some activities that will accompany you in your spiritual journey:</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Attend Daily Mass:</strong> Each morning, at 10:00A.M, your group will assemble at St. James Church for Mass (English-Speaking). At the end of each Mass, regardless of language, there is a blessing of the religious articles that you have with you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>On Feast Days, and Sundays:</strong> English Mass is at Noon
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Climb Apparition Hill:</strong> This mountainous hill is where the visionaries first encountered Our Lady. Also, at the base of this hill is a Blue Cross, where it is said Our Lady appeared to the children while they hid from the communist police in the early days of the alleged apparitions. When climbing, your group is invited to recite the Rosary, pausing five times for each decade of the Rosary. At the top of the hill, you will witness the exact location of the first alleged apparition of Our Lady to the visionaries, and enjoy private time in prayer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Climb Mt. Krizevac (Cross Mountain):</strong> In 1933, the villagers built a 30' high cross atop a mountain to commemorate Jesus' passion and death on the cross. Your group will have the opportunity to climb this mountain, and venerate that very cross. When climbing, your group is invited to pray the Stations of the Cross (to meditate on Jesus' suffering Road to Calvary), pausing fifteen times for each Station.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Apparitions:</strong> Each evening at 5PM or 6PM daylight savings time, your group will join the villagers and fellow pilgrims of Medjugorje in saying the Rosary as all anxiously await the alleged arrival of Our Lady to the visionaries. Following the apparition, at 6:40P.M (5:40 P.M. during Daylight Savings Time), feel free to stay at St. James Church and attend the Croatian Mass. Following the Croatian Mass, there is a Blessing of the Sick.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament:</strong> Our Lady has always called us to be close to her Son. For this, you will have the opportunity to adore the Blessed Sacrament at the outside altar of St. James Church. Adoration is held on Tuesdays and Saturdays; Veneration of the Cross is held on Fridays inside the church. Additionally, there is an Adoration Chapel on the grounds of St. James Church. Adoration is held here in the afternoon hours.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Meetings with the Visionaries:</strong> Pending their availability, your guide will arrange meetings with the visionaries at their homes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Visit to the Community of Cenacolo:</strong> You will have the opportunity to visit the community of Cenacolo, founded by the Sisters of Charity, for young men and women who have taken a wrong path and are on the road to recovery. You will be able to listen to their inspirational words about their journeys back to Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Prayer at the Statue of the Risen Christ:</strong> Located on the grounds of St. James Church, is the bronze statue of the Risen Christ. Many pilgrims sit and pray on the benches surrounding this peaceful statue. This statue miraculously seeps droplets of water at all times of the day, out of Christ's right knee.
    <br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="color: blue; ">* Your time in Medjugorje is intended to provide a personal retreat. As  such, your time in Medjugorje is not designed to be a “tour” but rather, to  provide opportunities for prayer and reflection as you feel called. Upon  arrival in the village, you will have an orientation tour. For the remainder of  your stay, you will not have a guide however, a representative of 206 Tours  will be available should you have any questions or requests. Daily Mass in  English and English confessions are available at St. James Church in Medjugorje. </span>
        <br><br>
        If you would prefer our traditional pilgrimage/tour of Medjugorje, we would recommend you consider our Tour #1 (<a href="www.206tours.com/tour1" class="link">www.206tours.com/tour1</a>) that provides a tour escort and spiritual leader throughout your stay.

        <h5>Oberammergau – Passion Play: Performance Day</h5>
    </div>
    <p>We will start our day by celebrating Mass. Then there will be some free time to relax and spend at your own
        leisure, before meeting to enjoy lunch together. After which we will make our way to the world famous Passion
        Play Theatre, to attend what will be a performance of a lifetime - the 42nd Oberammergau Passion Play. The Play
        runs for approximately five and a half hours, and is performed in two (2) Acts.
        <br><br>
        <b>Act I will begin at 2:30 P.M. – 5:00 P.M.</b><br>
        (Intermission: From 5:30 P.M. to 7:30 P.M., you will have dinner at a restaurant that is walking distance from
        the theatre)
        <br><br>
        <b>Act II will begin at 8:00 P.M., and conclude at 10:30 P.M.</b><br>
        What makes this performance so extraordinary is how the Stage truly comes alive! Not only in the decoration of
        the Set and the performance of the Actors, but with real animals and birds playing under the open sky. There are
        thirty-six (36) main actors who are dressed in white costumes, with their supporting cast dressed in greyish
        blue. The actors do not wear makeup, as that is their natural hair. Every scene is real, and live, so for
        example: the actor who is tied to the cross has to stay in that position for more than one (1) hour In between
        each scene, there are “Living Tableaus”, where the live actors perform intricate sets of the Old Testament. You
        can never describe the feeling you get, as you see these stories being performed right in front of you.

        <h5>Caesarea - Stella Maris - Nazareth - Tiberias<br>
            <small class="theme-holy-land">Theme: The Annunciation</small>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>Following breakfast at your hotel, your group will head to Caesarea, the former capital of Judea. You will have
        the opportunity to visit the archaeological remains of this ancient port, which aided as base for the Herodian
        navy. Shortly after the time of Jesus Christ, it was revealed to Peter, in Caesarea, that the Good News (to
        repent) is not only intended for Jewish people but also, the entire world. This is also the place which
        officially ended the tradition of adhering to the Jewish ceremonial laws. As a result, Peter baptized a group of
        gentiles, the Roman Centurion, Cornelius, and his family. Your tour continues as you travel North to Haifa. In
        Haifa, you will find Stella Maris, a Carmelite Monastery. The monastery is located above the cave where Elijah,
        the prophet, once lived. A colorful painting of this “wonder-worker” can be found on the ceiling of the Church.
        Following this visit, your group will depart Stella Maris and enjoy the scenic drive (with view of the bay of
        Acco) to Nazareth. In Nazareth, you will experience the town where Mary once lived and where Jesus lived as a
        child (Matthew 2:23). During the visit to Nazareth, your group will visit the Byzantine Church of St. Joseph, to
        which tradition identifies as the workshop and home of the Holy Family. Then make a stop at the Church of the
        Annunciation, which stands over the cave that tradition holds to be the home of the Virgin Mary. The cupola,
        which dominates modern-day Nazareth, is surmounted by a lantern which symbolizes “the Light of the World” Also,
        your group will visit Mary’s Well where the angel Gabriel announced to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the
        Son of God (Luke 1:30-34). Your first day culminates with a transfer to Tiberias. Upon arrival in Tiberias, you
        will check-in to your hotel for dinner and overnight.</p>

        <h5>Tiberias: Sea of Galilee<br>
            <small class="theme-holy-land">Theme: The Ministry of Christ in the Galilee</small>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>After breakfast we start with a boat ride on the Sea of Galilee. After this, see the remains of a boat that dates
        back to the time of Jesus, found buried in mud. Continue to the Mount of Beatitudes, scene of Jesus’ great
        Sermon on the Mount. Nearby is Tabgha, where Jesus fed the crowd of 5,000 and onto the site known as “Peter’s
        Primacy”. Here, after His resurrection, Jesus met with His disciples and told Peter to “feed my lambs; feed my
        sheep.” [John 21:9]. After lunch, we visit the remains of the fishing village of Magdala (Aramaic for
        “elegant”). During the time of Jesus it was a thriving place that exported dried fish and garum (a fish sauce
        reduction popular in Roman cooking). Excavations done by the Franciscans in the 1970s revealed the residential
        area of the village and the docks where the fishing boats would unload the fish caught in the Sea of Galilee. In
        2009 a chance discovery revealed a 1stCentury synagogue at the entrance to the village from West. It is also
        assumed that Mary Magdalen was born here. End the day at Capernaum, from where Jesus launched his Ministry; see
        the synagogue which dates to the time of Jesus and the church built over the site of Peter’s home. Dinner and
        overnight at your hotel.</p>

            <small class="theme-holy-land">Theme: The Transfiguration</small>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>Today, after breakfast, drive to Mount Tabor, the site of the Transfiguration, with time to reflect on Christ’s
        Humanity and Divinity. Mass here will be a good preparation for the journey to Jerusalem where Jesus was to
        suffer the crucifixion and resurrection. Drive down the Jordan Valley to Jericho, the oldest continuously
        inhabited city in the world, where we view Mt Temptation and an example of a Sycamore Tree. Visit the Baptismal
        site on the Jordan River then to Jerusalem, where you check-in to your hotel for dinner and overnight.</p>

            <small class="theme-holy-land">Theme: The Visitation and Nativity</small>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>Begin the day with a visit to the Second Temple scale model for an overview of Jerusalem as it was at the time of
        Jesus. A short drive takes us to the village of Ein Karem, birthplace of John the Baptist, to visit the church
        that commemorates his memory. Pray the Mystery of the Rosary on the walk up the hill to the Church of the
        Visitation. In the afternoon visit Bethlehem to see the cave at the Shepherds’ Field. The caves have soot marks
        of the fires that shepherd’s lit to keep warm while watching over their flocks. In the afternoon we will depart
        to Bethlehem, beginning at Manger Square, which stands in front of one of the oldest of Christian churches, the
        Church of the Nativity. Enter the Church and down to the Grotto of the Nativity which marks the spot of Jesus’
        birth. Beneath the Altar, there is a silver star with the Latin inscription: HIC DE VIRGINE MARIA JESUS CHRISTUS
        NATUS (Here Jesus Christ was born to the Virgin Mary.) After Mass we will return to the hotel in Jerusalem.
        Dinner and overnight.</p>

            <small class="theme-holy-land">Theme: Early Years in Jerusalem &amp; the Wilderness.</small>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>This morning drive down the Jordan Valley to Qumran where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Afterwards there may
        be time for a dip in the Dead Sea for those who want to. Drive through the Judean Wilderness where Jesus spent
        40 days fasting, and it is in this area that John the Baptist lived and baptized Christ. Then to Bethany where
        He raised Lazarus from the dead. Celebrate Mass here before returning to the hotel. Dinner and overnight.</p>

        <h5>Jerusalem: Mt. Of Olives - Gethsemane - Mt. Zion - Western Wal<br>
            <small class="theme-holy-land">Theme: Palm Sunday and the Agony in the Garden</small>
        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>From the Mount of Olives take in the panoramic view of Jerusalem. Then to the Pater Noster shrine, where Jesus
        taught His disciples the Pater Noster — The Lord’s Prayer (Luke 11:1-4). Walking down the Palm Sunday Road stop
        at the beautiful little church, Dominus Flevit - “The Lord wept.” It was here that Jesus wept over Jerusalem
        [Luke 19:41]. At Gethsemane reflect on Jesus’ final night. The Garden contains trees, the roots of which go back
        to the time of Jesus. Visit the Church of All Nations to pray at the “Rock of Agony,” a section of bedrock
        identified as the place where Jesus prayed alone in the garden on the night of His arrest. Visit the Western
        Wall, to see all that remains of the Temple compound that dates to the time of Jesus. From here we will continue
        to the house of the High Priest Caiaphas where He was interrogated and imprisoned. Now called Peter in
        Gallicantu (“crowing rooster”), this beautiful Church also commemorates Peter’s Denial of Christ, his repentance
        and then being forgiven by Jesus. After Mass we will go up to Mt. Zion to visit the Upper Room, which
        commemorates the Last Supper. Nearby is the Benedictine Church of the Dormition. Dinner and overnight at your
        hotel.</p>

        </h5>
    </div>
    <p>This morning we start the Via Dolorosa (The Way of the Cross) at the Antonia Fortress, where Jesus was condemned
        to death by Pontius Pilate. From there He was taken through the city to be crucified. The Stations of the Cross
        lead, through the markets of the Old City to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Here is the site of Calvary and
        the Tomb of Christ. Mass will be in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. After breakfast visit the Church of St
        Anne’s, the Pool of Bethesda and the Sisters of Zion. This afternoon there will be time to revisit the Old City.
