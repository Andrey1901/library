<h5>About Santiago de Compostela:</h5>
<p>The History of El Camino, The Way of St. James or St. James' Way Often known by its Spanish name, el Camino de
    Santiago, is the pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where
    legend has it that the remains of the apostle, Saint James the Great, are buried. The Way of St James has existed
    for over a thousand years. It was one of the most important Christian pilgrimages during medieval times. It was
    considered one of three pilgrimages on which a plenary indulgence could be earned; the others are the Via Francigena
    to Rome and the pilgrimageto Jerusalem. Legend holds that St. James's remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to
    northern Spain where they were buried on the site of what is now the city of Santiago de Compostela. There are some,
    however, who claim that the bodily remains at Santiago belong to Priscillian, the fourth-century Galician leader of
    an ascetic Christian sect, Priscillianism, who was one of the first Christian heretics to be executed.</p>

<h5>About Fatima:</h5>
<p>The Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima is one of most famous Marian shrines in the world. Drawn by apparitions of the

    Mary appeared to shepherd children on the 13th day of six consecutive months in 1917, starting on May 13th until
    October 13th. The events at Fatima gained particular fame due to their elements of prophecy and eschatology,
    particularly with regard to possible world war and the conversion of Russia.</p>

<h5>About Lourdes</h5>
<p>She came for you and for everyone of us! 6 million pilgrims come to Lourdes each year and 10,000 visit this site

    Gave de Pau, is Lourdes, one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the World. Lourdes is the birthplace of St
    Bernadette to whom Our Lady appeared in 1858 near the Grotto of Massabielle. Our pilgrimage and tour of Lourdes
    includes visits to the sanctuary and the Basilica of St Pius X, the world's largest underground church. Drink from
    the spring that the Virgin directed Bernadette to locate at the base of the grotto, which has flowed uninterrupted
    since 1858. Wash yourself in the baths where hundreds of miraculous cures have taken place. Contemplate Christ's
    Passion as you pray the unique three-dimensional Stations of the Cross. Attend the blessing of the sick, and
    participate in nightly candlelight processions requested by Our Lady. Daily Mass, and Mass at the Grotto on Sunday

    vastness, majesty, glory and awesomeness of God</p>

<h5>About Medjugorje</h5>
<p>On June 25, 1981, in the mountain village of Medjugorje in Herzegovina, Our Lady allegedly appeared to six children.
    She identified herself as the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Peace, and continues to allegedly appear to several of
    the visionaries. Her mission is to promote peace with God and mankind, through her Son, Jesus. Mary's own words to
    the children explained, "I have come to tell the world that God exists." 206 Tours has been arranging pilgrimages to
    Medjugorje since 1985.</p>

<h5>About Spain</h5>

    when you join 206 Tours pilgrimage.</p>

    a priest on November 1, 1946 and went on to continue his studies in Rome until 1948. He returned to Poland that same
    year for his first pastoral assignment in the village of Niegowic, which lasted seven months. He then was

<h5>Ireland: In the Footsteps of St. Patrick</h5>
<p>St. Patrick succeeded in bringing Catholicism to Ireland, and in time, the whole country converted from their pagan
    gods to the one true God. Although a small country, Ireland has played a large role in saving and bringing
    Christianity throughout the world. During the early Dark Ages, the Irish monasteries preserved Western writings
    while Europe remained in darkness. But as the Catholic country remained solidly Catholic, the Irish spread the faith
    to all corners of the world. </p>

<h5>The Shrine at Guadalupe:</h5>
<p>The Shrine at Guadalupe is considered the holiest place in the Western Hemisphere. President John F. Kennedy and
    French President Charles de Gaulle testified to this during state visits to Mexico. St. John Paul II preached to
    millions of the faithful from this holy Shrine during his 1979 visit to Mexico. The Basilica commemorates the Virgin
    Mary's appearance to a humble Indian and honors her request that a Shrine be built in Her honor. In December of
    1531, Juan Diego informed a skeptical bishop of his encounter with Mary. A few days later, Juan returned to the site
    of the vision and once again Our Mother appeared. The humble man relayed the bishop's request for proof of Her
    visitation, whereupon the Virgin instructed Juan to gather roses from the frozen, rocky terrain and present them to
    the bishop. Remarkably for the cool season, he found a great number of roses strewn all around. Gathering the roses
    in sackcloth, he hurriedly took them to the bishop. When he opened the cloak to present the roses to the cleric, it
    was not Only * the blooms that amazed the bishop. Stamped on the humble cloth was an image of the Virgin! The same
    miraculous image exists for you to see, hanging in splendor above the main altar. </p>
